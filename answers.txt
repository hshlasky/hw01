1. It would have taken a long time, because it would have required entering each article separately and searching one name at a time.
2. We came to a conclussion that using code to execute tasks like these is very efficient. We can use similar ideas in order to manage and monitor all kinds of data, such as monitoring the use of violence on a website.
3. In order to redo this task every hour, all we need to do is run the code again on articles that where changed in the last hour. We can add a clock to the code and write a command that executes the code every full hour. We can write it so that if it runs into an article that we already checked, it will check if the article was changed in the last hour. If it was, the code will run over the previous data, and if not it will skip the article.
